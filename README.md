Tips and tricks for using CDC's NHANES survey data

I have worked with NHANES data since 1984 and would like to make life easier for other users. I use Stata statistical software. However most documentation at the CDC website is for SAS users. Therefore I hope to post code and advice that will make life easier for those new to NHANES or new to Stata or both.
